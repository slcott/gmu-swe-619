## Goal: Contracts

1. The implementation of `findDup()` is in [Assignment2.java](src/main/java/com/teamsp26_1/Assignment2.java). The unit tests are parameterized, with the test values provided by `dupProvider()` in [Assignment2Test.java](src/test/java/com/teamsp26_1/Assignment2Test.java).

2. The transformed contract and the new implementation, named `findDupTransformed()`, are also in [Assignment2.java](src/main/java/com/teamsp26_1/Assignment2.java).
The new test values for the parameterized test are provided by `dupProviderTransformed()` in the same test file [Assignment2Test.java](src/test/java/com/teamsp26_1/Assignment2Test.java).

<!--## How to:
To run the code, the easiest way is to use Gradle. Simply run `./gradlew test`.

> Note: If you are unable to run `./gradlew`, it might be because it does not have the execution permission. Enable it with `chmod +x ./gradlew`.

If you would like to look at the test report, it will be under `build/reports/tests/test/index.html` *after* you have run the tests.-->

## How to

To run the code, the easiest way is to you to provided [Makefile](Makefile) and run `make`. This requires you to have the **Maven** build tool installed. 

If you don't have Maven installed, then you would compile and run the code with the good old `javac` and `java`.
