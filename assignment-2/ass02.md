## Goal: Contracts

1. The implementation of `findDup()` is in [Assignment2.java](src/main/java/Assignment2.java). The unit tests are in [FindDupTest.java](src/test/java/FindDupTest.java).

2. The transformed contract and new implementation, named `findDup2()`, are also in [Assignment2.java](src/main/java/Assignment2.java).
The new unit tests are in [FindDupTransformedTest.java](src/test/java/FindDupTransformedTest.java).

## How to:
To run the code, the easiest way is to use Gradle. Simply run `./gradlew test`.

> Note: If you are unable to run `./gradlew`, it might be because it does not have the execution permission. Enable it with `chmod +x ./gradlew`.

If you would like to look at the test report, it will be under `build/reports/tests/test/index.html` *after* you have run the tests.
